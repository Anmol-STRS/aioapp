## aioapp: Building Asynchronous Python Applications with Ease

This library provides a structured foundation for crafting robust and efficient asynchronous applications in Python, leveraging the power of `asyncio`. Whether you're building a high-performance web server, a data processing pipeline, or any application that benefits from concurrency, `aioapp` provides the building blocks you need.

### Key Features:

- **Application Structure:** Organize your application logic clearly with dedicated classes for applications, modules, and configurations.
- **Lifecycle Management:** Easily manage the startup and shutdown sequences of your application and its components.
- **Dependency Injection:** Simplify dependency management and promote code reusability through a lightweight injection mechanism.
- **Configuration Management:** Load configuration settings from various sources (e.g., environment variables, configuration files) with ease.
- **Logging:** Get started quickly with a pre-configured logging setup and extend it based on your needs.

### Getting Started:

1. **Installation:**
   ```bash
   pip install aioapp 
   ```

2. **Basic Structure:**
   ```python
   from aioapp.app import Application
   from aioapp.module import Module
   from aioapp.config import Config

   class MyModule(Module):
       async def start(self):
           print("MyModule started!")

   class MyApp(Application):
       def __init__(self, config: Config):
           super().__init__(config)
           self.add_module(MyModule())

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       config = Config.from_dict({"key": "value"})
       app = MyApp(config)
       app.run()
   ```

### Deeper Dive:

- **Application:** The heart of your project, managing the lifecycle of modules and providing access to core functionalities.
- **Modules:** Encapsulate specific functionalities within your application, promoting modularity and testability.
- **Configuration:** Easily manage your application's settings through a flexible and extensible configuration system.
- **Dependency Injection:**  Streamline your code and reduce boilerplate by injecting dependencies where needed.
- **Logging:** Leverage the pre-configured logging setup or customize it to fit your logging requirements.
